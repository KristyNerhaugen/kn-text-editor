# Challenge Nineteen: KN Text Editor![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

### For this challenge, I created a text editor that runs in the browser and also meets PWA criteria to function offline. Users can add text or delete that will save to the application. Users can create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection.

## Installation

### To use this application, access it using the Heroku deployed link here: [https://hidden-gorge-32319.herokuapp.com/](https://hidden-gorge-32319.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

### This application is to be used to create, edit, and save text while online or offline. The text can be reliably retrieved for later use.

## Credits

### Starter code was provided to me for this application. The starter code can be found here: [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme) I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this application. I especially used what I learned in Module 19 and the code that was given through Module 19 as a guide for this challenge. I also used the activities from virtual classes to assist me with this challenge. I used [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB) to better understand using IndexedDB, especially with the PUT method. I used this site: [codelab](https://web.dev/codelab-make-installable/) to find code for the butInstall event listener for the installation button. I used this site to better understand adding functionality to the install button: https://pwa-workshop.js.org/5-pwa-install/#add-an-installation-button. I also used the workbox documentation to better understand caching: [workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/).
